            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Ethiopia and came to the States in 2016 at age of 22. In Ethiopia, I have gone
                on to earn a degree in plant science from Bahir-Dar University. Therefore, when I came to the states, I
                continued with my studies and got my second
                bachelor's from Washington State University in Agricultural Biotechnology. But never took computer
                classes. As a result, this is my first-time doing work related to computer studies.

            <h2>Work experience</h2>

            <p> My first ever professional job was at Omo-Kuraz Sugar factory in Ethiopia. I was a field coordinator
                there. Once I moved to the states, I have done couple of different jobs. For instance, I was an unarmed
                security guard at Securitas Security
                USA and a driver for Lyft(Lyft Inc).

            <h1>projects I have done so far</h1>
            <p> So far, I have done some individual projects such as coding quiz, password generator, Daily
                work-scheduler, and Weather app. On top of the individual projects, I have cooperated with four of my
                classmates on a group project to build an app that returns a drink recommendation to the users when they
                search for their favorite movies.
