        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in Ethiopia and came to the States in 2016 at age of 22. In Ethiopia, I have gone
            on to earn a degree in plant science from Bahir-Dar University. Therefore, when I came to the states, I
            continued with my studies and got my second
            bachelor's from Washington State University in Agricultural Biotechnology. But never took computer
            classes. As a result, this is my first-time doing work related to computer studies.

        <h2>Work experience</h2>

        <p> My first ever professional job was at Omo-Kuraz Sugar factory in Ethiopia. I was a field coordinator
            there. Once I moved to the states, I have done couple of different jobs. For instance, I was an unarmed
            security guard at Securitas Security
            USA and a driver for Lyft(Lyft Inc).
