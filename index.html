            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Ethiopia and came to the States in 2016 at age of 22. In Ethiopia, I have gone
                on to earn a degree in plant science from Bahir-Dar University. Therefore, when I came to the states, I
                continued with my studies and got my second
                bachelor's from Washington State University in Agricultural Biotechnology. But never done computer
                classes. As a result, this is my first-time doing work related to computer studies.

            <h2>Work experience</h2>

            <p> My first ever professional job was at Omo-Kuraz Sugar factory in Ethiopia. I was a field coordinator
                there. Once I moved to the states, I have done  couple of different jobs. For instance, I was an
                unarmed security guard at
                Securitas Security USA and a driver for Lyft(Lyft Inc).
